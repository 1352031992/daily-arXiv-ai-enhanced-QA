Based on several examples, we conjecture that the generalized Schur limit as a function of $α$ solves a modular linear differential equation of fixed order, with coefficients depending on $α$. We also observe in examples that for Argyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_1,G)$ with $G=A_n,D_n$, the generalized Schur limit for certain negative integer values of $α$, coincides with the trace of higher powers of the quantum monodromy operator. This hints at a more general correspondence between the wall-crossing invariant traces on the Coulomb branch and the generalized Schur limit, which is related to the Higgs branch."}

Goertz"], "title": "A construction of surface skein TQFTs and their extension to 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies", "comment": "51 pages, comments welcome. v2: minor changes to introduction, references updated", "summary": "For a commutative Frobenius algebra $A$, we construct a $(2,3,3+\\varepsilon)$-dimensional TQFT $\\mathsf{AFK}_A$ that assigns to a 3-manifold a skein module of embedded $A$-decorated surfaces. These surface skein modules have been first defined by Asaeda--Frohman and Kaiser using skein relations that generalize the combinatorics of Bar-Natan's dotted cobordisms. For 3-manifolds with boundary, we show that surface skein modules carry an action by a certain surface skein category associated with the boundary, which yields a gluing formalism. Our main result concerns a partial extension of $\\mathsf{AFK}_A$ to dimension 4, which uses an inductive state-sum construction following Walker. As an example, the equivariant version of Lee's deformation of dotted cobordisms yields a TQFT that extends to 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies but not 3-handlebodies. Finally, we characterize the attachment of 4-dimensional 2-handles by means of a certain Kirby color and use it to compute the invariants of 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies in examples."}
