A character formula for $L_{s,a}^{\\pm}$ is obtained from that for the prefundamental modules over the untwisted quantum loop algebras by applying a character folding map. This allows us to realize minuscule prefundamental modules $L_{s,a}^{\\pm}$ for types $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ and $D_{n+1}^{(2)}$ in terms of the unipotent quantum coordinate ring associated with the fundamental $s$-th coweight, where $s = 1$ for type $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ and $s = n$ for type $D_{n+1}^{(2)}$. This result is a continuation of the realization of (co)minuscule prefundamental modules established by earlier works [J-Kwon-Park, Int. Math. Res. Not., 2023] and [J-Kwon-Park, J. Algebra, 2025]."}

In the critical level case, we identify simple quotients of these modules with the Wakimoto modules whose irreducibility was already established in arXiv:math/0602181, arXiv:1402.6100. We also generalize some Wakimoto modules constructed in arXiv:1409.5354 and identify them as generalized Whittaker modules."}

Based on several examples, we conjecture that the generalized Schur limit as a function of $α$ solves a modular linear differential equation of fixed order, with coefficients depending on $α$. We also observe in examples that for Argyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_1,G)$ with $G=A_n,D_n$, the generalized Schur limit for certain negative integer values of $α$, coincides with the trace of higher powers of the quantum monodromy operator. This hints at a more general correspondence between the wall-crossing invariant traces on the Coulomb branch and the generalized Schur limit, which is related to the Higgs branch."}

More specifically, starting from the data of a chiral CFT given in the form of a not necessarily semisimple modular tensor category C we use a three dimensional topological field theory with surface defects based on the surgery TFT of [arXiv:1912.02063] to construct a full CFT as a braided monoidal oplax natural transformation.\n  We make our construction explicit in the example of the transparent surface defect, resulting in the so-called Cardy case. In particular, we consider topological line defects and their action on bulk fields in these logarithmic CFTs, providing a source of examples for non-invertible and non-semisimple topological symmetries."}

Goertz"], "title": "A construction of surface skein TQFTs and their extension to 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies", "comment": "51 pages, comments welcome. v2: minor changes to introduction, references updated", "summary": "For a commutative Frobenius algebra $A$, we construct a $(2,3,3+\\varepsilon)$-dimensional TQFT $\\mathsf{AFK}_A$ that assigns to a 3-manifold a skein module of embedded $A$-decorated surfaces. These surface skein modules have been first defined by Asaeda--Frohman and Kaiser using skein relations that generalize the combinatorics of Bar-Natan's dotted cobordisms. For 3-manifolds with boundary, we show that surface skein modules carry an action by a certain surface skein category associated with the boundary, which yields a gluing formalism. Our main result concerns a partial extension of $\\mathsf{AFK}_A$ to dimension 4, which uses an inductive state-sum construction following Walker. As an example, the equivariant version of Lee's deformation of dotted cobordisms yields a TQFT that extends to 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies but not 3-handlebodies. Finally, we characterize the attachment of 4-dimensional 2-handles by means of a certain Kirby color and use it to compute the invariants of 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies in examples."}

This parallels the well-known result of non-existence of genuine compact quantum group symmetry obtained by the first author and his collaborators ([32] and the references therein)."}
