We\ndiscuss some results we have obtained (in part jointly with coauthors)\nregarding the representation theory of reductive algebraic groups over\nalgebraically closed fields of positive characteristic. These statements mainly\nconcern tilting modules, in particular their characters and support varieties."}

The Koszul dual of\n$U$, as defined by Positselski, is a curved dg-algebra. We establish an exact\nequivalence between the unbounded derived category of $U$ and an explicit\nquotient of the homotopy category of injective modules over the dual curved\ndg-algebra. This recovers a special case of a result of Positselski. In the\ncase where $U$ has finite global dimension, the quotient is trivial and hence\nthe unbounded derived category of $U$ is equivalent to the homotopy category of\ninjective modules over the dual curved dg-algebra."}
