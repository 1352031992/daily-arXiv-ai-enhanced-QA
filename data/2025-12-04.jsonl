Given a Lie algebroid pair $(L,A)$, i.e. a Lie algebroid $L$ together with a Lie subalgebroid $A$, we investigate isomorphism classes of infinitesimal deformations of $(L,A)$ modulo automorphisms from exponentials of derivations of $L$ and those from the exponentials of inner derivations of $L$, respectively. For the associated two deformation functors, we find the associated governing $L_\\infty$-algebras in the sense of extended deformation theory. Furthermore, when $(L,A)$ is a matched Lie pair, i.e. the quotient $L/A$ is also a Lie subalgebroid of $L$, we investigate isomorphism classes of infinitesimal deformations modulo automorphisms from exponentials of derivations along the normal direction $L/A$. The extended deformation theory of the associated deformation functor recovers the formal deformation theory of complex structures and that of transversely holomorphic foliations."}

We show that many aspects of the classical representation theory of real semisimple groups can be transposed to this context. In particular, we prove an analogue of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism and we introduce an analogue of parabolic induction. We use these tools to classify the non-unitary irreducible representations of $q$-deformed $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$. Moreover, we explicitly show how they converge to the classical admissible dual of $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$. For that purpose, we define a version of the quantized universal enveloping algebra defined over the ring of analytic functions on $\\mathbb{R}_+^*$, which specializes at $q = 1$ to the enveloping $\\ast$-algebra of $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{R})$."}

We identify natural sources of selfless inclusions in the realms of Z-stable and free product C*-algebras. As an application of this, we prove selflessness for a new family of C*-probability spaces outside the regime of free products and group C*-algebras. These include the reduced free unitary compact quantum groups."}

The typos are corrected, references on fusion ideal are added, and the discussions on the massive renormalization group are improved (v2). Explanations on the $\\mathbb{C}$ linear category and related structures have been added (v3)", "summary": "We propose a general quantum Hamiltonian formalism of a renormalization group (RG) flow with an emphasis on generalized symmetry by interpreting the elementary relationship between homomorphism, quotient ring, and projection. In our formalism, the noninvertible nature of the ideal of a fusion ring realizing the generalized symmetry of an ultraviolet (UV) theory plays a fundamental role in determining condensation rules between anyons, resulting in the infrared (IR) theories. Our algebraic method applies to the domain wall problem in $2+1$ dimensional topologically ordered systems and the corresponding classification of $1+1$ dimensional gapped phase, for example. An ideal decomposition of a fusion ring provides a straightforward but strong constraint on the gapped phase with noninvertible symmetry and its symmetry-breaking (or emergent symmetry) patterns. Moreover, even in several specific homomorphisms connected under massless RG flows, less familiar homomorphisms appear, and we conjecture that they correspond to partially solvable models in recent literature. Our work demonstrates the fundamental significance of the abstract algebraic structure, ideal, for the RG in physics."}
