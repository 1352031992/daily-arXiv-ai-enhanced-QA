Using Ringel's resolution quiver, we give a criterion to decide whether $A$ is minimal Auslander-Gorenstein. The criterion strongly relies on the parity of the selfinjective dimension of $A$."}

Then, for genuine representations of $p$-adic covering groups we formulate an upper bound conjecture for their wavefront sets using this covering Barbasch-Vogan duality and reduce it to anti-discrete representations. The formulation generalizes that of Ciubotaru-Kim and Hazeltine-Liu-Lo-Shahidi for linear algebraic groups. We prove this upper bound conjecture for Kazhdan-Patterson coverings of general linear groups."}

We then sketch how to compute the reduction of a lattice in this Banach space, which along with the Iwahori mod $p$ LLC, allows one to completely determine the mod $p$ reduction of $V_{k,{\\mathcal L}}$ for all weights $3 \\leq k \\leq p+1$ and all ${\\mathcal L}$ for $p \\geq 5$ (§5). These notes are a summary of our joint work with Anand Chitrao [CG24]. Emphasis is placed on motivation and background rather than completeness."}

Combining quiver-theoretic and combinatorial methods, we prove and extend a collection of conjectures posed by Elgin--Reading--Stella concerning the structural and enumerative properties of the wall-function coefficients. The tight grading perspective also provides a new proof of the Weyl group symmetry of the scattering diagram."}
