Beliakova, Putyra, and Wehrli introduced quantum Hochschild homology (qHH) and used it to define a quantization of annular Khovanov homology as qHH of the tangle bimodules of Chen-Khovanov and Stroppel. After introducing quantum topological Hochschild homology (qTHH), we construct a new stable homotopy refinement of quantum annular Khovanov homology and show that it agrees with qTHH of the spectral Chen-Khovanov tangle bimodules of Lawson, Lipshitz, and Sarkar. We also show that this new stable homotopy refinement recovers the construction introduced in earlier work of Krushkal together with the first and third authors."}

We establish their existence and define their orthogonality relations. When specialized to Kolb and Letzter's quantum symmetric pair coideal subalgebras, we associate, to each classical commutative triple, a unique corresponding quantum commutative triple. This leads to families of vector-valued orthogonal polynomials, which diagonalize a commutative algebra of difference-reflection operators and are invariant under sending $q \\mapsto q^{-1}$. Various examples of these vector-valued orthogonal polynomials are given and identified with Intermediate Macdonald polynomials"}

Hilbert--Schmidt Quantum Graphs relate to Weaver's picture of Quantum Graphs in a complex way: by defining certain hull operations, we find a bijection between certain subsets of both objects. Given a nfs weight $\\varphi$ on $M$ the operator-valued weight $\\varphi^{-1}$ can be defined, as considered by Wasilewski for direct sums of matrix algebras. We show how to build a natural self-dual Hilbert $C^*$-module from this, which mediates a bijection between HS Quantum Relations and projections $e\\in M\\bar\\otimes M^{\\text{op}}$. When $e$ is integrable for the slice-map $\\operatorname{id}\\otimes\\varphi^{\\text{op}}$ there is a related normal CP map $A\\colon M\\to M$: this is a Quantum Adjacency Operator, which has a Kraus operator representation built from the HS Quantum Relation. When $e$ and its tensor swap map are both integrable, we find certain symmetries of $A$. We illustrate our theory by a careful consideration of certain examples, including detailed links with the finite-dimensional setting."}

In this paper, we introduce the notions of $\\textit{reduction order}$ and $\\textit{reduction-factorization}$ on words, and use them to show that any right or left Noetherian pointed Hopf algebra over $k$ is affine. This result offers a partial affirmative answer to the classical affineness question for Noetherian Hopf algebras posed by Wu and Zhang \\cite{WZ2003}. For a pointed Hopf algebra $H$ over $k$, we construct a well-ordered set $X$ such that: (1) $H$ is generated, as an algebra, by the subset $X_I$ of irreducible letters (with respect to the reduction order); and (2) $X_I$ is finite whenever $H$ is right Noetherian."}

We check the formula against several explicit examples. Additionally, we study symmetry resolution for both categorical and invertible symmetries in (non-)diagonal RCFTs and comment on the subtleties that arise in these cases. Finally, we extend our analysis to diagonal non-unitary RCFTs, focusing on theories with generalized Haagerup-Izumi modular data, and find full agreement with the given formula."}

We show that the structure theory of $\\mathcal{C}$ and the representation theory of $\\mathcal{T}$ give rise to the rich combinatorial structures of seed data and cluster ensembles, via Grothendieck groups and homological algebra. We demonstrate that there is a natural dictionary relating cluster-tilting subcategories and their tilting theory to A-side tropical cluster combinatorics and, dually, relating modules over $\\underline{\\mathcal{T}}$ to the X-side; here $\\underline{\\mathcal{T}}$ is the image of $\\mathcal{T}$ in the triangulated stable category of $\\mathcal{C}$. Moreover, the exchange matrix associated to $\\mathcal{T}$ arises from a natural map $p_{\\mathcal{T}}\\colon\\mathrm{K}_0(\\operatorname{mod}\\underline{\\mathcal{T}})\\to\\mathrm{K}_0(\\mathcal{T})$ closely related to taking projective resolutions.\n  Via our approach, we categorify many key identities involving mutation, g-vectors and c-vectors, including in infinite rank cases and in the presence of loops and 2-cycles. We are also able to define A- and X-cluster characters, which yield A- and X-cluster variables when there are no loops or 2-cycles, and which enable representation-theoretic proofs of cluster-theoretical statements.\n  Continuing with the same categorical philosophy, we give a definition of a quantum cluster category, as a cluster category together with the choice of a map closely related to the adjoint of $p_{\\mathcal{T}}$. Our framework enables us to show that any Hom-finite exact cluster category admits a canonical quantum structure, generalising results of Geiß--Leclerc--Schröer."}

In this paper, we explore the properties of maximal commuting families of i-boxes in a more general setting, and define a certain matrix associated with such a family, which we call the exchange matrix. It turns out that, when considering the cluster algebra structure on the Grothendieck rings, this matrix is indeed the exchange matrix of the seed associated with the family, both in certain categories of modules over quantum affine algebras and over quiver Hecke algebras. We prove this by constructing explicit short exact sequences that represent the mutation relations."}

This is realized by considering the $2$-functor $\\mathsf{HK} : \\mathbf{Loc}^\\mathrm{op} \\to \\mathbf{CAT}$ which assigns to each Lorentzian manifold $M$ the category $\\mathsf{HK}(M)$ of Haag-Kastler-style AQFTs over $M$ and to each embedding $f:M\\to N$ a pullback functor $f^\\ast = \\mathsf{HK}(f) : \\mathsf{HK}(N) \\to \\mathsf{HK}(M)$ restricting theories from $N$ to $M$. Locally covariant AQFTs are recovered as the points of the $2$-functor $\\mathsf{HK}$. The main advantages of this new perspective are: 1.) It leads to technical simplifications, in particular with regard to the time-slice axiom, since global problems on $\\mathbf{Loc}$ become families of simpler local problems on individual Lorentzian manifolds. 2.) Some aspects of the Haag-Kastler framework which previously got lost in locally covariant AQFT, such as a relative compactness condition on the open subsets in a Lorentzian manifold $M$, are reintroduced. 3.) It provides a radically new perspective on descent conditions in AQFT, i.e. local-to-global conditions which allow one to recover a global AQFT on a Lorentzian manifold $M$ from its local data in an open cover $\\{U_i \\subseteq M\\}$."}
