This integrable system has been found to exhibit a remarkable variety of critical behaviors. The work is part of a series of papers devoted to their systematic study. We focus on the case when the lattice model possesses an additional ${\\cal Z}_r$ symmetry and consider the critical behavior near the so-called free fermion point. Among other things, discussed is the algebra of extended conformal symmetry underlying the universal behavior. The main result of the paper is the class of differential equations that describe the scaling limit of the solutions to the Bethe Ansatz equations. This is an instance of the correspondence between Ordinary Differential Equations and Integrable Quantum Field Theory (ODE/IQFT correspondence)."}

In this work, we propose another connection based on certain character identities between these vertex operator algebras and their modules. This relates the simple affine vertex operator algebras $L_k(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at admissible levels $k=-2+q/p$ to the rational $(q,3p)$-minimal models $L_\\mathrm{Vir}(c_{q,3p},0)$, and also extends to the nonadmissible levels with $q=1$.\n  Several special cases are particularly interesting. In the nonadmissible case $q=1$, the character identities extend to certain abelian intertwining algebras, specifically $\\mathcal{V}^{(p)}$ and the doublet $\\mathcal{A}^{(3p)}$. Specialising further to $p=2$, where $\\mathcal{V}^{(2)}$ is the simple small $\\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal algebra of central charge $c=-9$, this recovers, via the 4d/2d-correspondence, a known identity between the Schur indices of the 4d $\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory for $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and the 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ $(3,2)$ Argyres-Douglas theory.\n  In the boundary admissible case $q=2$, in a similar vein, we obtain an identity between the Schur indices of 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ Argyres-Douglas theories of types $(A_1,D_{2n+1})$ and $(A_1,A_{6n})$.\n  On the other hand, for integral levels, $p=1$, where both involved vertex operator algebras are strongly rational, our character identity induces a Galois conjugation between the representation categories $\\mathrm{Rep}(L_{-2+q}(\\mathfrak{sl}_2))$ and $\\mathrm{Rep}(L_\\mathrm{Vir}(c_{q,3},0))$. We conjecture that the characters are related by the action of certain Hecke operators.\n  Finally, we also sketch how to extend the results of this paper to relaxed highest-weight and Whittaker modules."}

Departing from existing Cherednik-algebra techniques, our new theory is based on an interplay between a natural generalization of dual Specht modules, and a Grothendieck spectral sequence for finite-dimensional algebras that admit (inverse) Schur functors. While the main result is regarding type $D_{2m} = G(2,2,2m)$, partial results are proved along the way for complex reflection groups $G(d,d,dm)$ and $G(m,1,d)$. Our framework should extend to all Weyl groups and general $G(m,r,n)$. A key ingredient in our methods is a unifying construction of modules over quantum wreath products, in terms of parabolic inductions on tensor products of the ``wreath modules'' introduced in the article. This construction simultaneously recovers (and hence provides a more transparent realization of) important families of modules in the literature, including simple modules over the Ariki-Koike algebra, (anti)spherical modules and the Kashiwara-Miwa-Stern modules over the affine Hecke algebra, as well as the Specht and simple modules over the Hu algebra."}

Our goal is to describe a general strategy to derive the string theory dual to given QFT, at least at the leading order in the 't Hooft expansion. The basic idea is to characterize the underlying worldsheet theory of the dual string theory as an extended two-dimensional differential graded Topological Field Theory (dg-TFT), i.e. present an $A_\\infty$-category of boundary conditions (\"D-branes\"). A basic aspect of the 't Hooft expansion is that D-branes arise from the addition of vector-valued degrees of freedom to the QFT. We propose that formal deformations of such \"fundamental modifications\" must match the formal deformations of the dual D-branes, which in turn capture the $A_\\infty$-category structure and thus the worldsheet dg-TFT. We discuss several systems for which a rigorous analysis along these lines is or should be possible."}

So far, only restricted classes of metaplectic Wigner distributions, satisfying particular structural properties, have allowed the analysis of microlocal properties. We first extend the microlocal results to all metaplectic Wigner distributions, including the well-known Kohn-Nirenberg quantization, and examine these findings in the framework of Fourier integral operators with quadratic phase. Finally, we analyze the phase space concentration of the (cross) Wigner distribution arising from the interaction of two states, with particular attention to interactions generated by certain Schrödinger evolutions. These contributions enable a more refined study of the so-called ghost frequencies."}

His approach was inspired by Weyl's proof of the character formula for irreducible representations of compact Lie groups. Hecht, Miličić, Schmid and Wolf gave an alternative construction using the localization theory of Beilinson and Bernstein: the discrete series are the global sections of standard Harish-Chandra sheaves on the flag variety attached to the closed orbits of the complexification of a maximal compact subgroup. Their approach was inspired by the Borel-Weil theorem. In this paper, we give an explicit correspondence between these parametrizations. First, for a nilpotent radical $\\mathfrak{n}$ of any Borel subalgebra, we establish a geometric formula for the $\\mathfrak{n}$-homology of a module over the universal enveloping algebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, in terms of its localization on the flag variety of $\\mathfrak{g}$. Then we give applications of the formula to the discrete series. First, we give a geometric proof of Schmid's result describing the $\\mathfrak{n}$-homology of discrete series representations for the nilpotent radical $\\mathfrak{n}$ attached to a Borel subalgebra containing the Lie algebra of a maximal torus. Using Osborne's formula, this gives the formula for the character on the elliptic set, and leads to the matching of Harish-Chandra's parameters for discrete series representations with the geometric parameters. This gives an alternative approach to the study of the discrete series. As an example, we deduce Blattner's conjecture on the multiplicities of K-types of the discrete series from the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem for the maximal compact subgroup."}
