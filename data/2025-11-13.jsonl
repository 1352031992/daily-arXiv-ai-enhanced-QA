In this article, we determine the branching rules for all irreducible supercuspidal representations of $G$, that is, we explicitly describe their decomposition upon restriction to a fixed maximal compact subgroup $\\mathcal{K}$ in terms of irreducible representations of $\\mathcal{K}$. We also present two applications of these decompositions, which verify two new conjectures in the literature for $G$. Together with the results from a previous paper by the author, this article completes the description of the branching rules for all irreducible smooth representations of $G$."}

Associated computer code under https://github.com/65537/beyond-minute", "summary": "Affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties in the fully Hodge-Newton decomposable (or minute) case are the only larger class of ADLVs which could be described completely in the past. Instances of them play important roles in arithmetic geometry, from Harris-Taylor's proof of the local Langlands correspondence to applications in the Kudla program. We study generalizations for many of the equivalent conditions characterizing them to obtain in this way a larger class of ADLVs that still have a similarly good and computable description of their geometry. To generalize the minute condition itself, we introduce the notion of depth for a Shimura datum - the minute cases being those of depth bounded by 1, the cases we study being the ones of depth less than 2."}

It is based on first translating the axioms for nets of operator algebras parameterized by regions in a space-time manifold into those for nets of real subspaces, and then study this structure from a perspective based on geometry and representation theory of Lie groups."}
