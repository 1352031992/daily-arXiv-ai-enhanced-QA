In this article, we explicitly determine its Picard dual and show that the Fourier-Mukai transform gives rise to the integral categorical local Langlands correspondence for the torus.

The emphasis is on the Archimedean theory, which concerns representations of classical Lie groups. Section 1 is about the basic theory, including the Howe Duality Theorem, and the conservation relations. Second 2 highlights the invariant and distributional nature of local theta correspondence via the proof of the conservation relations. Sections 3 and 4 explain how two fundamental invariants of representations behave under local theta correspondence. The final section discusses applications to unitary representation theory."}

These can be viewed as a far-reaching generalisation of rotational tangle diagrams for (virtual) upwards tangles, and constitute the topological analogue of XC-algebras, the minimum algebraic structure needed to construct an knot isotopy invariant following the construction of Lawrence and Lee. XC-tangles admit a very natural description in terms of the so-called XC-Gauss diagrams, and this equivalence lifts the well-known equivalence between virtual upwards tangles and upwards Gauss diagrams. For every XC-algebra $A$, there is a naturally defined strict monoidal full functor $Z_A: \\mathcal{T}^{\\mathrm{XC}} \\rightarrow v\\mathcal{E}(A)$ from the category of XC-tangles to the \"virtual category of elements of $A$\". When $A$ is the endomorphism algebra of a finite-dimensional representation of a ribbon Hopf algebra, this functor can be viewed as an extension of the corresponding Reshetikhin-Turaev functor.

This link invariant was originally introduced by M. Khovanov and L. Rozansky through a sophisticated matrix factorization technique based on the bicomplex structure, which depends on entire link diagrams and rapidly increases in complexity with the growth of a link. However, for particular link diagrams a local reduction is possible, allowing to eliminate vertices in a regular way, and thus, simplifying the KR polynomial and making it as simple as the Khovanov polynomial in the $N=2$ case. In particular, for a distinguished family of bipartite links, matrix factorization defined on MOY diagrams reduces just to planar cycles - very similar to the original Kauffman-Khovanov construction at $N=2$ for the Jones polynomial and its $t$-deformation. In the bipartite case, this can be done for any $N$. We make a further step of simplification and reduce from cohomology factor-rings in even variables crucially depending on a MOY diagram to vector spaces spanned by odd variables, so that the initial bicomplex of matrix factorizations becomes a monocomplex of just tensor products of $N$-dimensional vector spaces. We also find the explicit form of three universal morphisms which were guessed in a recent paper on this subject. Universality means independence of the other edges of the diagram, and we explain why this works in this particular case."}

By means of various categorical equivalences, it is shown that any braided commutative Yetter-Drinfeld algebra over any bialgebroid is also a braided commutative Yetter-Drinfeld algebra over the respective dual bialgebroid. This implies that the action bialgebroid of the dual exists, which is then proven to be isomorphic, as a bialgebroid, to the dual of the initial action bialgebroid: in short, (linear) duality commutes with the action bialgebroid construction. Similarly, for quantum groupoids to which the Drinfeld duality functors apply and the quantum duality principle holds, these Drinfeld duality functors are shown to commute with the action bialgebroid construction as well."}
